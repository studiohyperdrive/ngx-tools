## Concept

The Angular CDK Table is a very useful tool to build tables with, but is known to have a rather complex syntax and does not feature a bunch of common use-cases out of the box.

Using the CDK Table the `ngx-table` provides an easy to use template based system to build tables with, including various common use-cases such as column based sorting, selecting rows, detail rows and more.

Whilst this package is opinionated, the `ngx-table` works primarily with a ng-template based system, which ensures that any default implementation the table provides can be overwritten.
