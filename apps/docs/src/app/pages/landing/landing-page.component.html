					At <b>Studio Hyperdrive</b>, we’re all about building robust digital solutions.
					We’ve been passionately developing our JavaScript and Angular expertise since
					our foundation in 2018. That passion gave rise to <b>SHD Open Source</b>, our
					open source initiative. What started as a “love project” of some of our
					employees has grown into an active open source ecosystem powered by the
					ingenuity of our team and the broader developer community.
				</p>
				<div class="photo">
					<div class="line"></div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Since the launch in <b>2021</b>, we’ve already created <b>16 packages</b> for
					a.o. Angular, RXJS and Node.js. These tools have already spiked the interest of
					the international community. Our tools have been widely implemented across a
					<b>broad spectrum of applications and projects</b>. Thus helping developers
					worldwide streamline their workflows and build better applications.

					<img src="github.svg" alt="Github icon" />
					<h4>Collaboration with the community:</h4>
					<p>
						Engaging with the global developer community allows us to share knowledge,
						learn from others, and create better tools together. SHD Open Source isn’t
						only about giving back; it’s about working smarter, and innovate through
						shared effort.
					</p>

					<img src="zap.svg" alt="lightning bolt icon" />
					<h4>Efficiency and simplicity:</h4>
					<p>
						By leveraging open source packages (both our own and those from others),
						repetitive tasks can be eliminated and you can focus on solving real
						problems. These packages provide a tested, reliable foundation that reduces
						complexity and accelerates development timelines.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<img src="layout-dashboard.svg" alt="layout dashboard icon" />
					<h4>Proven building blocks:</h4>
					<p>
						Our open source tools offer a modular approach to development. Think of them
						as a toolbox full of building blocks that have already been validated in
						countless real-world applications. This means fewer bugs, less stress during
						production, and more time to focus on innovation. Moreover, all components
						are compliant with the latest WCAG standards.
