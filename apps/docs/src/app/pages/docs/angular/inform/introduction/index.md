## For Organisations

In modern web applications, effectively communicating with users is crucial. The `@studiohyperdrive/ngx-inform` package provides a comprehensive solution for user notifications and interactions. It helps organisations by:

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Provides clear and consistent ways to communicate with users through tooltips, modals, and notifications
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensures all notification components are WCAG compliant, making your application accessible to all users
- **Reduced Development Effort**: Offers ready-to-use, tested components for common notification patterns
- **Consistent Communication**: Standardizes how your application communicates with users across different features
- **Flexible Integration**: Easily adapts to your application's design system and requirements
- **Improved User Guidance**: Helps users understand complex features through tooltips and contextual help

## For Developers

At its core, `ngx-inform` is build to be WCAG and ARIA compliant, and will throw errors whenever the necessary setup has not been provided to ensure said compliancy.

Currently the package provides a `ngxTooltip` directive which can be used to attach a customizable ARIA compliant tooltip to any component and the `ngxModalService` which allows for both custom and predefined global modals to be used throughout the application.
